# Web-UI
This website is a part of my Coursera course on Web UI developement.
The website has been designed for a restraunt. It consists of the following:
* The home/index page which displays the restraunt's menu specials.
* The 'About Us' page contains some information about when the restraunt was built.
* The 'Contact Us' page contains the address, the restraunt's location on a map (which i am still working on), options to mail, call or skype us, and a feedback form.
* An additional 'Menu' page will be added to the website that will provide a brief description of each dish being served in the restraunt alongside it's price.\
   Each page of the website has a footer that contains our contact information and social media handles.\ 
   The navigation bar is added to ease the user's experience of navigating from page to page.\
   The Bootstrap framework was used to fasttrack the process of developing the website.
